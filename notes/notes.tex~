Polynomials are implemented as flat arrays of integer coefficients. The coefficients may be fixed precision integers (fixnums)
or high precision integers (bignums).

\begin{lstlisting}
  (defun base-offset (num-vars degree)
    (if (< degree 0)
        0
        (ncr (+ num-vars degree)
        degree)))

  (defun power-offset (powers)
    (let ((degree (reduce #'+ (cdr powers))))
      (cond
        ((or (null (cdr powers))
             (= (+ (car powers) degree) 0))
         0)
        (t
          (+ (number-terms (length powers) (1- degree))
          (power-offset (cdr powers)))))))

  (defun offset (powers)
    (+ (base-offset (length powers) (1- (reduce #'+ powers)))
    (power-offset powers)))
  
\end{lstlisting}

Systems of linear equations with polynomial coefficients can be solved using the fraction free Gaussian elimination (FFGE) algorthim.
This can be implemented for either integers or polynomials in general.

There are two approaches to implementing FFGE.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item
    Directly implementing FFGE for matrices of polynomial (or integer) entries
  \item
    Choosing a set of evaluation points for all the variables in the polynomial entries and then evaluating
    the matrix at each of these points. This results in a set of matrices of numbers only, which can then be
    solved using FFGE in the standard way. These can then be combined back into the polynomial solutions using
    Lagrange interpolation
\end{enumerate}

In both of these cases, bignum integers are required. This can be overcome by first choosing a set of prime numbers and taking
the input matrix modulo these. Then either of the above processes can be used to generate solution matrices for each of the primes.
Finally, these can be combined back into the complete solution using the Chinese Remainder theorem. Using this procedure, only
fixnum integers are required.
