fpoly
=====

A package for manipulation of dense multivariate polynomials. Contains routines for:

* Making and manipulating polynomials
* Basic operations on polynomials (addition, subtraction, multiplication etc.)
* Making matrices of polynomials
* Assorted operations on polynomial matrices

In the near future, I intend to add other useful routines, including Lagrange Interpolation.
